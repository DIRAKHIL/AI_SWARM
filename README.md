## ✨ Features  
- **Dynamic Agent Generation**: Auto‑spawn workers based on task graphs, inspired by AutoGPT’s recursive decomposition.  
- **Modular Multi‑Agent Workflows**: Define directed workflows via LangGraph for clear task orchestration.  
- **Centralized Knowledge Store**: Persist intermediate results and heuristics in Neo4j for reuse and audit.  
- **Self‑Improvement Loop**: Apply evolutionary algorithms and RLlib‑based rewards to refine agent policies over time.  
- **Scalable Messaging**: Use Redis Pub/Sub for low‑latency, distributed inter‑agent communication.  
- **Cloud‑Native Templates**: Prototype agents quickly with Vertex AI Agent Development Kit (ADK).  
- **Kubernetes‑Ready**: Autoscale compute via Horizontal/Cluster Autoscalers following best practices.  
- **Vector Embeddings**: Store and query semantic vectors in Pinecone for advanced retrieval tasks.

## ⚙️ Architecture  

### 1. Master Agent  
- **Role**: Decomposes the user’s input into a directed acyclic task graph.  
- **Implementation**: Leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT‑4) for natural‑language planning, deployed via Vertex AI ADK.

### 2. Worker Agents  
- **Specializations**: Researcher, Coder, Tester, Optimizer, etc., each with distinct prompts and toolkits.  
- **Lifecycle**: Spawned and retired dynamically based on performance metrics.

### 3. Orchestrator & Messaging  
- **Bus**: Redis Pub/Sub channels for topic‑based routing and fault‑tolerant delivery.  
- **Workflow Engine**: LangGraph defines agent nodes and directed edges for task dependencies.

### 4. Knowledge Repository  
- **Graph DB**: Neo4j holds the task graph, intermediate artifacts, and agent “blueprints” for later spawning.  
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone indexes embeddings of documents, code snippets, and evaluation reports.

### 5. Self‑Improvement Loop  
- **Evolutionary Operators**: Mutation and crossover on agent configurations to explore variations.  
- **Reinforcement Signals**: RLlib computes reward feedback from the Evaluator Agent based on accuracy, efficiency, and resource usage.
